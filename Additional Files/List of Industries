## Cleaning

In order to get the best reaults from our model building and EDA, I cleaned the Data to be easy to read and manipulate. The first step of cleaning throught the job postings was to go through and delete all the repeating postings. After, using the location I catogorized each application into a a state catogory. Using keywords from the scraped industry catagory, I was able to block job postings under my indutries catigories.
