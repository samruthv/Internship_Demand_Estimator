One of my greatest passions is education. Not only the education that you recienve in the lecture rooms, but also the practical hands on expirince one gets during there internships and co-ops inbetweeen or during the school year. As a former undergrad student myself I have seen how stressful and intimidating trying to get your first internship can be. I wanted to create a model that really shows where these students are applionmg to and which industries are the most popular.
