###**Why?**
*One of my greatest passions is education. Not only the education that recieved in the lecture rooms, but also the practical hands on expirince one gets during internships and co-ops inbetweeen or during the school year. As a former undergrad student myself I have seen how stressful and intimidating trying to get your first internship can be. I wanted to create a model that really show and understand the vast data of students around the country sending application into the job force.*
