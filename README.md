  *I am a firm beliver that knowlegde leads to prosperity and one of my greatest passions is education. Not only the education that is recieved in the lecture rooms, but also the practical, hands on expirince one gets during internships and co-ops inbetweeen the school year. As a former undergrad student myself I have seen how stressful and intimidating trying to land your first internship can be. I wanted to create a model that really shows and understands the vast data of students around the country sending application into the massive void of the job force.*
